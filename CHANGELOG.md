     ```

2. **Review Context**:

   - Assess existing features, known issues, and architectural decisions.

3. **Inform Responses**:

   - Use the gathered context to guide your suggestions or actions.

4. **Proceed Only After Context Review**:
   - Ensure all actions align with the project's scope and continuity requirements.

### **After Making ANY Code Changes**

1. **Update Documentation Immediately**:

   - Add new features/changes to the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Update `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` if there are changes to architecture, features, or limitations.

2. **Report Documentation Updates**:

   - Use the following format to report updates:
     ```
     Updated CHANGELOG.md: [details of what changed]
     Updated PROJECT_SCOPE.md: [details of what changed] (if applicable)
     ```

### **Documentation Update Protocol**

1. **Never Skip Documentation Updates**:

   - Always update documentation, even for minor changes.

2. **Update Before Responding to the User**:

   - Ensure documentation is complete before providing feedback or solutions.

3. **For Multiple Changes**:

   - Document each change separately.
   - Maintain chronological order.
   - Group related changes together.

4. **For Each Feature/Change, Document**:

   - What was changed.
   - Why it was changed.
   - How it works.
   - Any limitations or considerations.

5. **If Unsure About Documentation**:
   - Err on the side of over-documenting.

### **Log Analysis Protocol**

1. **When Reviewing Conversation Logs**:

   - Briefly report findings using this format:
     ```
     Analyzed conversation: [key points relevant to task]
     ```

2. **When Examining Code or Error Logs**:

   - Report findings using this format:
     ```
     Reviewed [file/section]: [relevant findings]
     ```

3. **Include Minimal Context for Current Task**:
   - Ensure findings directly inform the current task at hand.

### **Critical Notes**

- This read-first, write-after approach ensures consistency and continuity across conversations.
