# SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Watsch application and provides guidelines for maintaining security best practices.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 🔒 **Credential Protection**
- **API Key Logging Eliminated**: Removed all instances of API key logging that could expose credentials in production logs
- **Environment Variable Security**: Test endpoints that exposed environment variables have been removed
- **Secure Logging**: All logging now only reports configuration status (YES/NO) without exposing actual key values

### 🛡️ **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- **Universal Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized using dedicated sanitization functions
- **XSS Protection**: HTML content is properly escaped and sanitized before DOM insertion
- **Data Validation**: Strict validation on all API endpoints with type checking and format validation

### 🚦 **Rate Limiting**
- **Enhanced Rate Limiting**: Implemented stricter rate limits with endpoint-specific thresholds:
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/minute
  - Movie Night: 15 requests/minute  
  - Search: 10 requests/minute
  - Recommendations: 20 requests/minute
  - General API: 30 requests/minute
- **IP-based Tracking**: Rate limiting tracks by client IP address
- **Proper Error Responses**: Rate limit violations include retry-after headers

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Production Auth Protection**: Mock authentication is blocked in production environments
- **Input Validation**: All authentication requests are validated for email format and password strength
- **Secure Token Handling**: JWT tokens are properly validated and user information is extracted securely

### 🌐 **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- **Hardened CSP**: Removed unsafe-eval directive to prevent code injection
- **XSS Protection**: Enhanced CSP with upgrade-insecure-requests and block-all-mixed-content
- **Restricted Sources**: Limited allowed sources for scripts, styles, and other resources

### 📡 **HTTP Security Headers**
- **Comprehensive Headers**: Full suite of security headers implemented:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS only)
  - Cross-Origin policies for COEP, COOP, CORP

## Security Considerations

### ⚠️ **Known Limitations**
1. **In-Memory Rate Limiting**: Current rate limiting resets on server restart. For production, implement Redis or database-backed rate limiting.
2. **CSP Unsafe-Inline**: Still requires 'unsafe-inline' for Svelte components. Consider using nonces in the future.
3. **Mock Authentication**: While secured against production use, ensure proper Auth0 configuration in all environments.

### 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps**
1. **Implement Redis Rate Limiting**: Replace in-memory rate limiting with persistent Redis-based solution
2. **Add Request Signing**: Implement request signing for sensitive operations
3. **Audit Logging**: Add security event logging for monitoring
4. **CORS Configuration**: Review and tighten CORS policies
5. **Session Management**: Implement proper session timeout and rotation

## Security Testing

### 🧪 **Automated Security Checks**
- Input validation testing on all endpoints
- Rate limiting verification
- XSS prevention testing
- CSRF protection validation

### 🔍 **Manual Security Review**
- Credential exposure audit completed ✅
- Authentication bypass testing completed ✅  
- Input validation review completed ✅
- Rate limiting assessment completed ✅

## Incident Response

### 🚨 **Security Incident Checklist**
1. Identify and contain the security issue
2. Assess the scope and impact
3. Implement immediate fixes
4. Review logs for indicators of compromise
5. Update security measures to prevent recurrence
6. Document lessons learned
